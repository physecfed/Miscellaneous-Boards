# Miscellaneous-Boards
A repository for miscellaneous KiCad and Altium PCB projects which don't fit cleanly into other repos. Primarily includes the *Level Shifter* series of boards, designed to perform logic level shifting between standard 3.3V LVCMOS signaling used by microcontrollers and industrial 0-10V signaling as used by PLCs, VFDs, and other such equipment. Mainly designed for interfacing to CNC equipment, and is designed for expedient production - hence the through-hole construction.

All boards in this repository are licensed under the CERN OHL v1.2 unless otherwise noted in a board-specific README file.
